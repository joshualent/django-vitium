# django-vimuim

A Django template for starting a new Django project using Vite (using django-vite package). This project is inspired by [lithium](https://github.com/wsvincent/lithium) by wsvincent and other django templates.

This is my personal template and is not meant to be "lean" or "interchangable," it just includes the many useful third-party packages that make it into most of my Django projects.

## Future

I would like to try to make this a more customizable template. Considering switching to a CLI that will take options in it and set up those specific libraries using Jinja templating (think [Cokkiecutter Django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django)).

Before a CLI for setup, I'm consider a fork or `tailwind` branch which will setup the project for Tailwind (+ DaisyUI) instead of Sass and Bootstrap.

Neither of these are in development yet, so consider forking the project and making your own changes to the included batteries.
